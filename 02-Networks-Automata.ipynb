    "\n",
    "Because $\\frac{log(n)}{n}$ gets small as n gets big, we can say that for *any* connectivity probability (above zero), there will be a graph size large enough that it is ~100% likely to be connected.\n",

    "* a lifesaving product or knowledge, we have reason to rejoice\n",

So spread through a network can lead to power-law distributions. Depending on the exponent, these may have fat tails and hide a large number of dramatic surprises that would not be expected from thin-tailed distributions.\n",

    "When does this occur in real life?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our specific numbers in the present example are contrived, path dependence is a critical factor in many real-world systems:\n",

    "* health outcomes\n",
    "* hiring and promotion\n",
    "* education\n",
    "* criminal justice\n",
    "* participation in risk-taking and investment activities\n",
    "\n",
    "__How does this connect to the distributions and patterns we've been talking about?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, in the path-dependent case,\n",
    "* we have a *series of multiplied values which are not independent*\n",
    "    * (since each multiplication is  dependent on prior state) \n",
    "* where, in the ensemble expectation, we *assumed* that all of the events (values being multiplied) are independent\n",
    "    * (they only depend on the \"rules of the game\" -- every trial starts with 1 dollar)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once again, we see a compounding effect leading to drastically large (or small) numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "A concrete example is insurance pools. A sufficiently large and diverse business can \"self insure\" anything from employee health costs to its own fleet of vehicles. Such self insurance can work, provided the losses are independent enough that the ensemble average holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a company's employees were all concentrated in an area with common health hazards (say, contaminated air or ground water) then the sequence of repeated of heath-cost losses would not be independent -- risk would be magnified as health losses compound over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "__How do we use this knowledge?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time we are looking to achieve an \"average\" result over time, we can ask whether the steps are truly independent. As a technology example, we may have a device that we deploy in the field which features high uptime (time between failures). \n",
    "* To achieve long-term reliability, we want to ensure that the device is as stateless as possible when it recovers\n",
    "* If a device retains state (e.g., internal storage or config) which affect its future success (after recovering from a failure) then the sequence of failures becomes path dependent"
