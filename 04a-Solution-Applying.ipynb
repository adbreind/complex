    "# Applying Complex Systems Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a practical scenario that can exhibit complex system dynamic and which we often need to address in business contexts (as well as social, political, and other spheres): __product introduction and viral adoption__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, there are many elements that can influence the viral success (or lack thereof) for a product and viral success is notoriously hard to craft or predict, notwithstanding all of those influencer courses that make promises.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General approach: network analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine the various users, influencers, and potential users of our product as nodes in a graph or network which captures their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we understand the characteristics of the network, we can learn about how our product might spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the network space has attractors states representing little connection vs. massive connection, we would want to understand\n",
    "* if our product is likely to enter the system in the \"massive connection\" basin of attraction (which we'd like)\n",
    "* whether the system exhibits tipping point behavior at the \"edge\" between the low and high connection attractor regions\n",
    "    * what parameters the system is more or less sensitive to and which might allow us to manipulate or at least plan for better odds\n",

    "Small world graphs, or small world networks, are a type of graph in which most nodes can be reached from every other node by a small number of steps. This type of network was first described in the 1960s by social psychologist __Stanley Milgram__ in his \"small world experiment\". The experiment highlighted the concept of \"six degrees of separation,\" suggesting that any two people on Earth could be connected through a chain of six acquaintances or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Milgram's experiment, he sent packages to 160 random people living in Boston, asking them to forward the package to a friend or acquaintance who they thought would bring the package closer to a designated final individual, a stockbroker also living in Boston. Surprisingly, the packages reached the stockbroker in an average of six steps, hence the term \"six degrees of separation\".\n",

    "This discovery has had far-reaching implications, influencing several fields from sociology to computer science. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the late 1990s, mathematicians __Duncan Watts__ and __Steven Strogatz__ formalized the concept of small world networks in a mathematical context. \n",
    "\n",
    "They proposed a simple model for generating such networks, starting with a regular lattice and then rewiring some of its edges at random. This model revealed that even a small amount of rewiring could give rise to a network with both high clustering (like a regular lattice) and short average path lengths (like a random graph), a hallmark of small-world networks."
