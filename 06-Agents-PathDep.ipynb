    "\n",
    "Allen Downey summarizes this model/thought experiment brilliantly in his book *Think Complexity*:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Schelling model of the world is a grid where each cell represents a house. The houses are occupied by two kinds of agents, labeled red and blue, in roughly equal numbers. About 10% of the houses are empty.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> At any point in time, an agent might be happy or unhappy, depending on the other agents in the neighborhood, where the â€œneighborhood\" of each house is the set of eight adjacent cells. In one version of the model, agents are happy if they have at least two neighbors like themselves, and unhappy if they have one or zero.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The simulation proceeds by choosing an agent at random and checking to see whether they are happy. If so, nothing happens; if not, the agent chooses one of the unoccupied cells at random and moves.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You will not be surprised to hear that this model leads to some segregation, but you might be surprised by the degree. From a random starting point, clusters of similar agents form almost immediately. The clusters grow and coalesce over time until there are a small number of large clusters and most agents live in homogeneous neighborhoods.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If you did not know the process and only saw the result, you might assume that the agents were racist, but in fact all of them would be perfectly happy in a mixed neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement this model to see\n",
    "* what a simple agent-based model implementation looks like\n",
    "* how the \"homophily index,\" or fraction of similar neighbors required for happiness, affects the overall segregation of the grid"

    "When does this occur in real life?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our specific numbers in the present example are contrived, path dependence is a critical factor in many real-world systems:\n",
    "* economic actors\n",
    "* health outcomes\n",
    "* hiring and promotion\n",
    "* education\n",
    "* criminal justice\n",
    "* participation in risk-taking and investment activities\n",
    "\n",
    "__How does this connect to the distributions and patterns we've been talking about?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, in the path-dependent case,\n",
    "* we have a *series of multiplied values which are not independent*\n",
    "    * (since each multiplication is  dependent on prior state) \n",
    "* where, in the ensemble expectation, we *assumed* that all of the events (values being multiplied) are independent\n",
    "    * (they only depend on the \"rules of the game\" -- every trial starts with 1 dollar)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once again, we see a compounding effect leading to drastically large (or small) numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "A concrete example is insurance pools. A sufficiently large and diverse business can \"self insure\" anything from employee health costs to its own fleet of vehicles. Such self insurance can work, provided the losses are independent enough that the ensemble average holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a company's employees were all concentrated in an area with common health hazards (say, contaminated air or ground water) then the sequence of repeated of heath-cost losses would not be independent -- risk would be magnified as health losses compound over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "__How do we use this knowledge?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time we are looking to achieve an \"average\" result over time, we can ask whether the steps are truly independent. As a technology example, we may have a device that we deploy in the field which features high uptime (time between failures). \n",
    "* To achieve long-term reliability, we want to ensure that the device is as stateless as possible when it recovers\n",
    "* If a device retains state (e.g., internal storage or config) which affect its future success (after recovering from a failure) then the sequence of failures becomes path dependent"
